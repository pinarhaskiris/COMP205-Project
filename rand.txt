Horrible to my senses are
Spitting companions!
I already run, where do I run?
Do I jump in the waves?

Every mouth constantly pursed,
Every throat gurgling,
Wall and floor always sprayed â€”
Curse upon spittle souls!

I prefer to live wickedly and simply
A free bird upon the rooftops,
Preferably amongst a den of thieves,
Oath and marriage breakers!

Curse the culture, when she spews!
Curse the league of virtues!
Even the purest holiness
Doesn't wear gold in her mouth.

Nietzsche
