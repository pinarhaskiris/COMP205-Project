Richard Skrenta created the first computer virus, called the Elk Cloner, at the age of 15. The virus spread to other computers by monitoring the floppy drive and copying itself to any floppy diskette that was inserted into the computer. Once a floppy was infected, it would infect all other computers that used the diskette. A computer that was infected would display a short poem on every 50th boot.
